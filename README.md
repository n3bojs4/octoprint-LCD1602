# OctoPrint-Lcd1602

This plug-in allows you to control a 16X2 lcd display (hd44780 connected to port I2C) to display the octoprint status. It is useful for people like me who have a printer without a display.
It indicates on which port the printer is connected, the progress of printing. It also displays the remaining print time (thanks to a simple method).
This plugin has to evolve:
- add options in the interface
- new version for oled displays :)

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:

## Configuration

Nothing to do for the moment :D
